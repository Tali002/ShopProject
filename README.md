# ShopProject
This project implements a basic shopping cart system with a graphical user interface for adding, viewing, and finalizing purchases. Users can browse products, add them to their cart, and attempt to checkout by deducting the total price from their available balance. This project demonstrates fundamental functionalities for managing a shopping cart application.

## Description

This project simulates a shopping cart system with the following features:

- Product Management: While this version doesn't include a full product database, it allows for creating basic product objects with names and prices.
- User Accounts (Simplified): The project assumes a single user with an in-memory balance for simplicity. You can extend it to integrate with a user database in the future.
- Cart Management: Users can add and remove products from their cart, with the cart displaying product details and quantities.
- Cart Total Calculation: The application calculates the total price of all items in the cart.
- Cart Finalization: Users can attempt to finalize their purchase. The application deducts the total price from the user's balance (assuming sufficient funds).
- Insufficient Balance Handling: If the user's balance is insufficient, the application displays an error message.
## Features

- Graphical User Interface (GUI): The project utilizes a basic GUI framework (replace with your specific framework, e.g., Swing, JavaFX) to provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the shopping cart functionalities.
- Product Addition: Users can browse products and add them to their cart through the GUI.
- Cart Viewing: The cart displays a list of added products, including their names, prices, and quantities.
- Cart Removal: Users can remove unwanted items from their cart through the GUI.
- Total Price Display: The application displays the total price of all items currently in the cart.
- Balance Deduction: Upon finalization, the application attempts to deduct the total price from the user's balance.
- Error Handling: The application handles scenarios where the user's balance is insufficient for the purchase.
